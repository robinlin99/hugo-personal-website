üëã Hey! I'm Robin, an ECE and CS student @ Cornell University. I am passionate about emerging technologies in the areas of self-driving technologies and robotics. 

üìç I will be starting my career at Amazon Robotics as an Embedded SDE upon graduation in May 2022. I was an Embedded SDE Co-op at Amazon Robotics for the Fall of 2021, a SWE Intern at Apple for the Summer of 2021, and a Systems Test Engineering Intern at Uber ATG for the Summer of 2020.
